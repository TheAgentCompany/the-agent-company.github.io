              (<b>Total of {leaderboard.number_of_tasks}</b>)

              - The <span style={{color: '#0ea7ff'}}><b>% Score</b></span> is a weighted metric combining the sub checkpoint resolution rate 
              and resolution rate (50% each). It's calculated as: (sub checkpoints resolved / total sub checkpoints Ã— 0.5) + 
              (resolution status Ã— 0.5), where resolution status is 1 if resolved, 0 if not.
              <br />
              - The <span style={{color: '#0ea7ff'}}><b>Avg Steps</b></span> refers to the average number of steps taken by the model to execute the task.

              were able to reproduce the patch generations.

              necessarily mean the underlying model is open-source.
